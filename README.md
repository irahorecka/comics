## Quick start

Find and download the Calvin and Hobbes comic strip published on January 2, 1990:

```python
import comics

ch = comics.search("calvinandhobbes", date="1990-01-02")
ch.download("calvinandhobbes.png")
```

</div>

## Find comics

Available comics can be found using the `directory` class:

```python
import comics

# List available comics - total of 401
comics.directory.listall()
# >>> ("1-and-done", "9-chickweed-lane-classics", "9chickweedlane", "9to5", ... )

# Find endpoints for Calvin and Hobbes
comics.directory.search("Calvin and Hobbes")
# >>> ("calvinandhobbes", "calvinandhobbesenespanol")
```

First, pass the desired endpoint to `comics.search`. For example, to search for Calvin and Hobbes comics in english use `comics.search("calvinandhobbes")`; for spanish, use `comics.search("calvinandhobbesenespanol")`.

## Search and download comics

Then, search for a comic strip by passing `date` into `search()`:

```python
import comics

# Get a Calvin and Hobbes comic strip by date
ch = comics.search("calvinandhobbes", date="2013-05-13")  # Also accepts datetime.date or datetime object

# Get a random Calvin and Hobbes comic strip
random_ch = comics.search("calvinandhobbes", date="random")
```

Finally, show, download, or stream the comic strip:

```python
# Show comic strip - opens in Jupyter notebook or default image viewer application
ch.show()

# Download comic strip - defaults to {endpoint}.png if an export path is not provided
# E.g., a Calvin and Hobbes comic strip will be exported as "calvinandhobbes.png" in the current working directory
ch.download()

# Stream comic strip - useful if custom image content manipulation is desired
ch.stream()
```

### Retry logic

If a comic strip fails to load due to CDN delays or missing image data, a retry mechanism is built into `download()`, `show()`, and `stream()`. You can control this behavior via:

- `retries`: number of attempts before failing (default = 5)
- `base_delay`: exponential backoff seed time in seconds (default = 0.5)

This improves reliability when fetching newly released strips or handling transient issues.

| Attempt | Wait Before Attempt (sec) | Cumulative Time (sec) |
|---------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| 1       | 0.0                       | 0.0                    |
| 2       | 0.5                       | 0.5                    |
| 3       | 1.0                       | 1.5                    |
| 4       | 2.0                       | 3.5                    |
| 5       | 4.0                       | 7.5                    |
| 6       | 8.0                       | 15.5                   |

Retry behavior can be customized per call:

```python
# Try 3 times total with shorter delay
ch.download(retries=2, base_delay=0.25)
```

## Attributes

An instantiated `search` class will have the following public attributes:

```python
import comics

garfield = comics.search("garfield")
garfield.endpoint
# >>> "garfield"
garfield.title
# >>> "Garfield"
garfield.start_date
# >>> "1978-06-19"
```

An instantiated `search` class with `date` will have the following public attributes:

```python
import comics

garfield = comics.search("garfield", date="2000-08-20")
garfield.endpoint
# >>> "garfield"
garfield.title
# >>> "Garfield"
garfield.date
# >>> "2000-08-20"
garfield.url
# >>> "https://www.gocomics.com/garfield/2000/08/20"
garfield.image_url
# >>> "https://assets.amuniversal.com/6694c52099bd01365606005056a9545d"
```

## Exceptions

An exception will be thrown if the queried date is unregistered or before the comic's origin date:

```python
import comics

try:
    peanuts = comics.search("peanuts", date="1900-01-01")
    peanuts.download()
except comics.exceptions.InvalidDateError:
    print("Whoops, an invalid date was queried.")
```

An exception will be thrown if the queried endpoint is unregistered:

```python
import comics

try:
    invalid_comic = comics.search("invalid_endpoint", date="2000-01-01")
    invalid_comic.download()
except comics.exceptions.InvalidEndpointError:
    print("Whoops, an invalid endpoint was queried.")
```

An exception will be thrown if Playwright fails to fetch a comic (e.g., browser not installed or page error):

```python
import comics

try:
    garfield = comics.search("garfield", date="2020-05-05", force_playwright=True)
    garfield.download()
except comics.exceptions.ComicsPlaywrightError:
    print("Playwright failed to fetch the page. Check your Playwright installation.")
```
